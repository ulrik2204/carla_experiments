# Carla Experiments

Some experiments with the Carla simulator.

## Setup
This project uses python 3.8.10 because it is currently the latest version of python supported by CARLA. I suggest using pyenv to ensure you are using the correct version of python. This project also uses poetry to manage dependencies.

```bash
# First time setup
poetry shell # Activate the virtual environment
poetry install
```
